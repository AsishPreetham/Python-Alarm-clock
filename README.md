# Python-Alarm-clock
A simple Alarm clock using Pythom


Creating an alarm using Python involves utilizing various modules and functions to monitor the current time and trigger an action when the alarm time is reached. The process typically follows a few key steps.

First, the program imports the necessary modules, such as datetime, time, and winsound (for sound playback). These modules provide the required functionality for time manipulation, pausing the program, and playing sounds.

Next, a set_alarm() function is defined, which takes the desired alarm time as an argument. Inside this function, a loop is initiated to continuously check the current time against the alarm time. This is achieved by using the datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M") function to retrieve the current time and comparing it with the specified alarm time.

If the current time matches the alarm time, an action is triggered. In this example, the program prints a message (e.g., "Wake up!") and plays a beep sound for a specific duration using the winsound.Beep() function.

To ensure the program doesn't continuously check the time and consume excessive resources, a pause is introduced between time checks. In this case, the time.sleep(60) function is used to pause the program for 60 seconds (1 minute) before checking the time again.

To use the alarm, one simply needs to set the desired alarm time and call the set_alarm() function with that time as the argument. The program will run until the alarm time is reached, at which point the action will be triggered.

Overall, creating an alarm using Python involves a combination of time monitoring, conditional checks, and action triggers. By leveraging the appropriate modules and functions, it is possible to implement a simple yet effective alarm system
